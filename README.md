# The Creek Generator

The Creek Generator is a generating space.

## Structure
When the program is run, the creek is generated element by element. At various points, dependent on drawing a random number, poetic interludes appear. These, too, change depending on chance.

## How to run

### Terminal

```
python3 that\ which\ was\ left.py
```

### Web

### Twined
The latest edition consumes `twined.`, the introduction to a larger collection of poems.

### Commands
The original generator consumed `commands.`, first published in DIAGRAM, as its source material.
