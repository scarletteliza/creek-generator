# The Creek Generator

The Creek Generator is a generating space.

## Structure
When the program is run, the creek is generated element by element. At various points, dependent on drawing a random number, poetic interludes appear. These, too, change depending on chance.

## How to view
Visit [THE CREEK GENERATOR](https://scarletteliza.github.io/creek-generator/).

## Texts

### Twined
The latest edition consumes `twined.`, the introduction to a larger collection of poems.

### Commands
The original generator consumed `commands.`, first published in DIAGRAM, as its source material.
